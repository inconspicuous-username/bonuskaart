<h1>How?</h1>
<p>
	The privacy preserving functionality of <a href="/index.html">bonuskaart.com</a>  comes from a combination of two effects. </p><p>Firstly, by using a different bonuskaart for every purchase, personal information will be fragmented. If there are <i>n</i> cards in the database, each bonuskaart will only contain <i>1/n<sup>th</sup></i> of a single person's personal information.
	</p>
<p>
	The second part comes from the fact that each bonuskaart can be used by an arbitrary amount of people. When trying to identify a single person, every other person using the same bonuskaart adds noise. The more people using the same card, the noisier the data becomes, the more private it becomes.</p>

<h2>How does the website work</h2>
<p>
	When you visit <a href="/index.html">bonuskaart.com</a>  for the first time, it will send a request for a new bonuskaart. Upon reception, the server will randomly select a barcode and send it to the client. When the client receives this bonuskaart, they will store it in a cookie. This cookie will expire at 23:59 of that day.</p>

<p>
	When visiting the website again, the website will check for cookies. If it finds one, it will use bonsukaart stored in the cookie instead of requesting a new one.
	The reuse of the same bonuskaart is required for the handheld scanners. To unlock a scanner one scans a bonuskaart, but to checkout you need to scan the same bonuskaart at a payment terminal.

</p>


<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<p><b>Doesn't the cookie store identifiable information?</b><br>
	Yes, but this cookie never leaves your device.
	The checking for cookies happens on the client (i.e. your smartphone).
	Take a look at the code, if you want to see for yourself.
</p>


<p><b>Wouldn't a single card for all the users add more noise?</b><br>
	Yes. However, if two people with the same barcode in the same store, want to use the handheld scanners it may cause problems.<br>
	I don't know what the exact behavior would be, but I suspect it would prevent you taking out two scanners with the same bonuskaart.
	Another possibility is that, at checkout, the system would confuse you for the other customer, making you pay for someone else's groceries.
